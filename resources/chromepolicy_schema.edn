This oneof is known as a \"synthetic\" oneof, and this field must be its sole member (each proto3 optional field gets its own synthetic oneof). Synthetic oneofs exist in the descriptor only, and do not generate any API. Synthetic oneofs must be ordered after all \"real\" oneofs. For message fields, proto3_optional doesn't create any semantic change, since non-repeated message fields always track presence. However it still indicates the semantic detail of whether the user wrote \"optional\" or not. This can be useful for round-tripping the .proto file. For consistency we give message fields a synthetic oneof also, even though it is not required to track presence. This is especially important because the parser can't tell if a field is a message or an enum, so it must always create a synthetic oneof.
