This annotation will be applied to the surrogate by prefixing it with the name of the custom info type followed by the number of characters comprising the surrogate. The following scheme defines the format: {info type name}({surrogate character count}):{surrogate} For example, if the name of custom info type is 'MY_TOKEN_INFO_TYPE' and the surrogate is 'abc', the full replacement value will be: 'MY_TOKEN_INFO_TYPE(3):abc' This annotation identifies the surrogate when inspecting content using the custom info type 'Surrogate'. This facilitates reversal of the surrogate when it occurs in free text. Note: For record transformations where the entire cell in a table is being transformed, surrogates are not mandatory. Surrogates are used to denote the location of the token and are necessary for re-identification in free form text. In order for inspection to work properly, the name of this info type must not occur naturally anywhere in your data; otherwise, inspection may either - reverse a surrogate that does not correspond to an actual identifier - be unable to parse the surrogate and result in an error Therefore, choose your custom info type name carefully after considering what your data looks like. One way to select a name that has a high chance of yielding reliable detection is to include one or more unicode characters that are highly improbable to exist in your data. For example, assuming your data is entered from a regular ASCII keyboard, the symbol with the hex code point 29DD might be used like so: ⧝MY_TOKEN_TYPE."},

Included files are those that match at least one item in `include_regex` and do not match any items in `exclude_regex`. Note that a file that matches items from both lists will _not_ be included. For a match to occur, the entire file path (i.e., everything in the url after the bucket name) must match the regular expression. For example, given the input `{bucket_name: \"mybucket\", include_regex: [\"directory1/.*\"], exclude_regex: [\"directory1/excluded.*\"]}`: * `gs://mybucket/directory1/myfile` will be included * `gs://mybucket/directory1/directory2/myfile` will be included (`.*` matches across `/`) * `gs://mybucket/directory0/directory1/myfile` will _not_ be included (the full path doesn't match any items in `include_regex`) * `gs://mybucket/directory1/excludedfile` will _not_ be included (the path matches an item in `exclude_regex`) If `include_regex` is left empty, it will match all files by default (this is equivalent to setting `include_regex: [\".*\"]`).

Dictionary words are case-insensitive and all characters other than letters and digits in the unicode [Basic Multilingual Plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_%28Unicode%29#Basic_Multilingual_Plane) will be replaced with whitespace when scanning for matches, so the dictionary phrase \"Sam Johnson\" will match all three phrases \"sam johnson\", \"Sam, Johnson\", and \"Sam (Johnson)\". Additionally, the characters surrounding any match must be of a different type than the adjacent characters within the word, so letters must be next to non-letters and digits next to non-digits. For example, the dictionary word \"jen\" will match the first three letters of the text \"jen123\" but will return no matches for \"jennifer\". Dictionary words containing a large number of characters that are not letters or digits may result in unexpected findings because such characters are treated as whitespace. The [limits](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/limits) page contains details about the size limits of dictionaries. For dictionaries that do not fit within these constraints, consider using `LargeCustomDictionaryConfig` in the `StoredInfoType` API."},

This annotation will be applied to the surrogate by prefixing it with the name of the custom infoType followed by the number of characters comprising the surrogate. The following scheme defines the format: info_type_name(surrogate_character_count):surrogate For example, if the name of custom infoType is 'MY_TOKEN_INFO_TYPE' and the surrogate is 'abc', the full replacement value will be: 'MY_TOKEN_INFO_TYPE(3):abc' This annotation identifies the surrogate when inspecting content using the custom infoType [`SurrogateType`](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/reference/rest/v2/InspectConfig#surrogatetype). This facilitates reversal of the surrogate when it occurs in free text. In order for inspection to work properly, the name of this infoType must not occur naturally anywhere in your data; otherwise, inspection may find a surrogate that does not correspond to an actual identifier. Therefore, choose your custom infoType name carefully after considering what your data looks like. One way to select a name that has a high chance of yielding reliable detection is to include one or more unicode characters that are highly improbable to exist in your data. For example, assuming your data is entered from a regular ASCII keyboard, the symbol with the hex code point 29DD might be used like so: ⧝MY_TOKEN_TYPE"},
