At any given moment, exactly one page is the current page, the current page is considered active, and the flow associated with that page is considered active. Every flow has a special start page. When a flow initially becomes active, the start page page becomes the current page. For each conversational turn, the current page will either stay the same or transition to another page. You configure each page to collect information from the end-user that is relevant for the conversational state represented by the page.

For example, a date range, a proper name such as a geographic location or landmark, and so on. Entities represent actionable data for your application. When you define an entity, you can also include synonyms that all map to that entity. For example, \"soft drink\", \"soda\", \"pop\", and so on. There are three types of entities: * **System** - entities that are defined by the Dialogflow API for common data types such as date, time, currency, and so on. A system entity is represented by the `EntityType` type. * **Custom** - entities that are defined by you that represent actionable data that is meaningful to your application. For example, you could define a `pizza.sauce` entity for red or white pizza sauce, a `pizza.cheese` entity for the different types of cheese on a pizza, a `pizza.topping` entity for different toppings, and so on. A custom entity is represented by the `EntityType` type. * **User** - entities that are built for an individual user such as favorites, preferences, playlists, and so on. A user entity is represented by the SessionEntityType type. For more information about entity types, see the [Dialogflow documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/entities-overview).",

At any given moment, exactly one page is the current page, the current page is considered active, and the flow associated with that page is considered active. Every flow has a special start page. When a flow initially becomes active, the start page page becomes the current page. For each conversational turn, the current page will either stay the same or transition to another page. You configure each page to collect information from the end-user that is relevant for the conversational state represented by the page.

You can also create your own custom entities for matching custom data. For example, you could define a vegetable entity that can match the types of vegetables available for purchase with a grocery store agent.

If a person says to you \"they are orange\", you need context in order to understand what \"they\" is referring to. Similarly, for Dialogflow to handle an end-user expression like that, it needs to be provided with context in order to correctly match an intent. Using contexts, you can control the flow of a conversation. You can configure contexts for an intent by setting input and output contexts, which are identified by string names. When an intent is matched, any configured output contexts for that intent become active. While any contexts are active, Dialogflow is more likely to match intents that are configured with input contexts that correspond to the currently active contexts. For more information about context, see the [Contexts guide](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/contexts-overview)."},

If a person says to you \"they are orange\", you need context in order to understand what \"they\" is referring to. Similarly, for Dialogflow to handle an end-user expression like that, it needs to be provided with context in order to correctly match an intent. Using contexts, you can control the flow of a conversation. You can configure contexts for an intent by setting input and output contexts, which are identified by string names. When an intent is matched, any configured output contexts for that intent become active. While any contexts are active, Dialogflow is more likely to match intents that are configured with input contexts that correspond to the currently active contexts. For more information about context, see the [Contexts guide](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/contexts-overview).",
