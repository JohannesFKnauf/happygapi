  "G Suite Vault API: operations.
  Retention and eDiscovery for Google Workspace. To work with Vault resources, the account must have the [required Vault privileges] (https://support.google.com/vault/answer/2799699) and access to the matter. To access a matter, the account must have created the matter, have the matter shared with them, or have the **View All Matters** privilege. For example, to download an export, an account needs the **Manage Exports** privilege and the matter shared with them.

  Optional parameters: filter, pageToken, pageSize
  
  Lists operations that match the specified filter in the request. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `UNIMPLEMENTED`. NOTE: the `name` binding allows API services to override the binding to use different resource name schemes, such as `users/*/operations`. To override the binding, API services can add a binding such as `\"/v1/{name=users/*}/operations\"` to their service configuration. For backwards compatibility, the default name includes the operations collection id, however overriding users must ensure the name binding is the parent resource, without the operations collection id."

  Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of 1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`."
