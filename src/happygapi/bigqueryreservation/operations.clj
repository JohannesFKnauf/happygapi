(defn list$
  "Required parameters: name
  
  Lists operations that match the specified filter in the request. If the
  server doesn't support this method, it returns `UNIMPLEMENTED`.
  
  NOTE: the `name` binding allows API services to override the binding
  to use different resource name schemes, such as `users/*/operations`. To
  override the binding, API services can add a binding such as
  `\"/v1/{name=users/*}/operations\"` to their service configuration.
  For backwards compatibility, the default name includes the operations
  collection id, however overriding users must ensure the name binding
  is the parent resource, without the operations collection id."
